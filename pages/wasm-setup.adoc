= Getting started with D on WebAssembly
:source-highlighter: pygments

Recently, through Sebastiaan Koppe's excellent work in porting DRuntime to run on WebAssembly (WASM), we can now run D code in the browser with a full runtime and Phobos implementation. This guide will detail how you can set this up and start using D in your own web projects.

I will assume you are using a Linux system, but you can probably use the same principles to get it working under Windows. If there is enough demand, I may expand the guide with specific Windows instructions later.

== Prerequisites

* Git
* Clang
* a D compiler (LDC/DMD/GDC)
* CMake 3.8+
* Ninja
* GNU make
* Python
* libcurl for Phobos' std.net.curl (e.g., libcurl4 on recent Ubuntu)
* zlib-dev (e.g., zlib1g-dev on Ubuntu)
* LLVM dev 10.0+
* Binaryen

On Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04, you can use the following command to install these (may work on other Debian-based distros; not tested):

	sudo apt install git make ldc cmake ninja-build zlib1g-dev libcurl4 llvm-dev clang-tools-10 binaryen

Also while we're here, make a new directory to house everything to do with your D on WASM setup:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir wasm-dlang && cd wasm-dlang
----

== Setting up WASI-Libc

Make sure you are in your `wasm-dlang` directory, if you chose to make one.

.Clone the repository and its submodules
[source,bash]
----
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-libc
----

.Build the sysroot
[source,bash]
----
cd wasi-libc
make WASM_CC=`which clang` WASM_AR=`which llvm-ar` WASM_NM=`which llvm-nm`
----

== Setting up LDC

=== Building LDC

.Go back to `wasm-dlang`
[source,bash]
----
cd ..
----

.Clone the repository and its submodules
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/skoppe/ldc.git
cd ldc
git checkout wasm
git submodule update --init
cd ..
----

.Create the build directory and build scripts
[source,bash]
----
mkdir build-ldc && cd build-ldc
cmake -G Ninja ../ldc \
	-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
	-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/../install-ldc
----
(You may want to change 'Release' to 'RelWithDebInfo' if you're gonna be working on patches to LDC)

.Build LDC
[source,bash]
----
ninja -j4
----
This will take a couple minutes and use plenty of RAM.

There will be _tons_ of warnings; you can ignore them.

If you have a _lot_ of free RAM and a multicore CPU, you can change the `-j4` to `-j8` or even higher, to do more work in parallel.

=== Building DRuntime

.Go back to `wasm-dlang`
[source,bash]
----
cd ..
----

.Create the build directory and build script
[source,bash]
----
mkdir build-druntime && cd build-druntime
echo -e '#!/bin/sh'"\n\nrm -rf $PWD/out\nCC=clang $PWD/../build-ldc/bin/ldc-build-runtime --ninja --buildDir='$PWD/out' --dFlags='-mtriple=wasm32-unknown-unknown-wasm;-fvisibility=hidden' --targetSystem='WebAssembly' --ldcSrcDir='$PWD/../ldc' --cFlags='-target wasm32-unknown-unknown-wasi --sysroot=$PWD/../wasi-libc/sysroot'\nchown -R $USER:`id -gn` $PWD/out" > build
chmod +x build
----

.Run the build script
[source,bash]
----
sudo ./build
----

== Running it on the web

We're all done with setting up a version of LDC that can compile D to WASM. However, we need a WASI implementation in order to be able to use the generated code.

To run D on the web, we can use a library I wrote called d-wasm-glue, which implements a WASI interface, as well as some glue code to make it more convenient to use JS objects from D, and a wrapper around LDC to pass all the necessary command line options for building WASM.

The wrapper it generates, `wasm-ldc`, has the exact same syntax as LDC for its command line options.

.Go back to `wasm-dlang`
[source,bash]
----
cd ..
----

.Compile the glue code
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/brianush1/d-wasm-glue
cd d-wasm-glue
rdmd wasm-ldc.d --build-wasm-compiler --add-to-path # you may choose to remove the '--add-to-path' if you do not want it automatically added to your $PATH in ~/.profile
----

=== Example

.example.d
[source,d]
----
import std.stdio;
import glue;

void main() {
	writeln("Hello, from D!"); // open the JS console to see this message
	js.document.body.innerHTML = "Hello, <em>everyone!</em>";
}
----

.example.html
[source,html]
----
<body>
	<script src="glue.min.js"></script>
	<script>
		runFile("example.wasm");
	</script>
</body>
----

.Command to build:
[source,bash]
----
wasm-ldc example.d
----

NOTE: You do need to run this through a local web server; loading `example.html` directly as a file in your browser will not work due to CORS.
